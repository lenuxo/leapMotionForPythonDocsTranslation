# 用户体验指导 User Experience Guidelines

我们建议遵循如下用户体验指导方针以确保你的应用易学易用。

+ **要知道符号很难被记忆和学习。**  要避免强迫用户去学习复杂的交互手势

+ **要从真实世界的行为和物力交互中获取灵感。**  近似自然的物理交互行为，使你的应用使用起来更直观和自然，也减少了用户的学习成本

+ **同时也不要被真实世界中的不便或限制所束缚，这是由你来创造的世界。**  交互行为不一定必须总是和它原本的方式一样。为什么用户必须伸出手去抓一个东西？为什么不让这个东西自己过来？给用户“原力”！

+ **用户应该感觉到他们的意图被增强了而不是被限制或掩盖了。**  比如，当用户使用鼠标时他们一般习惯自己的动作被放大（换句话说，他们可不想为了把指针在屏幕上移动10英寸而真的把鼠标移动10英寸）。对于手势交互来说，增强或夸张反馈会有比较好的效果。有些人会比其他人更敏感，所以这些增强属性应该有能让用户自定义的设置。

+ **专注于对用户的行为给予动态反馈。他们得到的反馈越多，就会与你的程序进行更明确地交互。**  比如，用户需要知道他们“按下”了一个按钮，但当他们可以知道他们的手放在按钮的上方或者已经按下了多少的时候，交互过程会更加高效。 

+ **屏幕上的视觉（如代表手的形象、工具或数字反馈）应该是简洁的、有功能性的、无干扰性的.** 用户不应被画面中的工具或环境影响而分神。你的重点内容也不应受到“装饰物”的干扰。

+ **执行破坏性或不可逆转性的操作的动作要被设计的比执行无破坏性操作的动作更具有刻意性。** 



The following user experience guidelines comprise our recommendations to ensure that your Leap-enabled application is easy to learn and use.

+ Keep in mind that symbology can be difficult to learn and memorize.
*Avoid forcing users to learn complex hand gestures to interact with your application.*

+ Instead, draw inspiration from physical interaction and real-world behaviors.
*The more physically inspired interactions are, the less training a person needs and the more intuitive and natural your application feels.*

+ Don’t feel constrained by the limitations or inconveniences of the real-world — this is your world.
*Interaction doesn’t have to be the way it has always been. It can be any way we imagine it to be. Why force the user to reach all the way out and grab an object? Why not have the object reach back? — Give them “the force”!*

+ The user should feel as if their intent is amplified rather than subdued or masked.
*For example, users often like their movements to be amplified when using a mouse (i.e. they don’t need 10 inches of mouse movement to move 10 inches on screen). For gestural interactions, amplifying or exaggerating responses can have an even more positive result. Keep in mind that some people are more sensitive than others, so link this exaggeration to a sensitivity setting for users to modify this effect to their preference.*

+ Concentrate on giving the user dynamic feedback to their actions. The more feedback they have, the more precisely they can interact with your software.
*For example, the user will need to know when they are “pushing” a button, but can be more effective if they can see when they are hovering over a button, or how much they are pressing it.*

+ On screen visuals (such as representations of hands, tools, or digital feedback) should be simple, functional, and non-intrusive.
*The user should not be distracted from the task by their tools or environment. Decoration should not distract from your purpose.*

+ Require more deliberate action for destructive or non-reversible acts than for harmless ones.
*Subtle gestures should be reserved for subtle actions. Conversely, an act such as closing an application or deleting a file can be a non-reversible event requiring a more deliberate action. Double check with the user when unsure, such as a prompt for confirmation.*

+ Provide a clear delineation and specific sense of modality between acts of navigation and interaction, unless both are simple or one is handled automatically (or with assistance). Mixing the two in a complex situation can lead to confusion or disorientation.
*For example, moving an object while having the user simultaneously position their viewing angle inside a 3D environment is inherently difficult. However, if the viewing angle moves automatically in response to the user’s movement, then working with the object is easier. Likewise, when navigating a large data set the user will want the view to move easily, but when highlighting a portion of the data the view should remain still.*

+ Overall, imagine that your user is faced with no instructions or tutorials on how to use your application.
*Strive at all costs to make their first intuitive guesses the right ones. Where appropriate, create more than one proper way to do something.*
